# Earthbook
Final project for Code Louisville

Index.html is the homepage of Earthbook. 
forms are incorporated on this page for the user to login by email and input password. 
There is a music player for CSS. 
When login is selected, a pop up box appears. 
'Forgot password' and 'Create New Account' buttons are linked to other webpages, with other features. 

Upon selection of Forgot Password, you are taken to a new page. I feature media quearies here, by showing columns that change size when page is minimized or maximized, with active links that will take you to other useful webpages. 
A draggable text box is on the page and I included forms that will send the user an email when 'Send' is selected. 
The 'Create New Account' page is where the user must input information into the form and it will be validated and autofill is an option.
