# Earthbook
Final project for Code Louisville

Earthbook was created with the inspiration of social media websites.

Index.html is the homepage of Earthbook. 
On this page there is button that will display a pop-up box with some information. 
Forms are incorporated on this page for the user to login by email and input password as a javascript feature. The email information provided is then displayed back to the user. A music player has been added for CSS and entertainment. 

'Forgot password' and 'Create New Account' buttons are linked to other webpages, with other features. 

Upon selection of 'Forgot Password' you are taken to a new page. I feature CSS media quearies, by showing columns that change size when page is minimized or maximized, with active links that will take you to other useful webpages. 
Another javascript feature on this page includes a draggable text box and I included forms that will send the user an email when 'Send' is selected. 
The 'Create New Account' page is where the user must input information into the form and it will be validated with autofill as a helpful option.
